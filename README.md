# GammaCGC
This is a repository for the cleanup of the CGC LO+NLO (Inclusive EM) Code. Its contents will be added gradually but it will contain:

[] Massless LO for Photon
[] Massless NLO (KT) for Photon
[] Massless NLO (Large N) for Photon
[] Massless LO for Dilepton
[] Massless NLO (KT) for Dilepton
[] Massless NLO (Large N) for Dilepton

[] Massive LO for Photon
[] Massive NLO (KT) for Photon
[] Massive NLO (Large N) for Photon
[] Massive LO for Dilepton
[] Massive NLO (KT) for Dilepton
[] Massive NLO (Large N) for Dilepton

Additionally 

[] Isolation Cuts 
[] Fragmentation Contribution Subtraction
