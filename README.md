# GammaCGC
This is a repository for the cleanup of the CGC LO+NLO (Inclusive EM) Code. Its contents will be added gradually but it will contain:

[] Massless LO for Photon  <br />
[] Massless NLO (KT) for Photon <br />
[] Massless NLO (Large N) for Photon <br />
[] Massless LO for Dilepton <br />
[] Massless NLO (KT) for Dilepton <br />
[] Massless NLO (Large N) for Dilepton <br />

[] Massive LO for Photon <br />
[] Massive NLO (KT) for Photon <br />
[] Massive NLO (Large N) for Photon <br />
[] Massive LO for Dilepton <br />
[] Massive NLO (KT) for Dilepton <br />
[] Massive NLO (Large N) for Dilepton <br />

Additionally  <br />

[] Isolation Cuts  <br />
[] Fragmentation Contribution Subtraction <br />
